# Tools
You're learning to be a true IT professional, and to do this, you must learn to work with real tools:

- the command line, terminal, or shell
- a professional text editor
- web browsers and their developer tools
- file & version management
- HTML5 & CSS3


### The shell
As a typical computer user, you interact with a graphical view of the system presented by your operating system.  However, underneath this is more direct and barebones interface to your operating system, the shell.  The shell allows us to navigate files, alter permissions, execute system tasks, and build and run the programs we will be developing. On a Windows computer this is PowerShell. On an Apple computer, it's Terminal. Generically it is called the shell. The shell is the IT professional's lifeblood; embrace it. The sooner you get comfortable with it, the easier your IT life will be.


### Professional Editor
You'll also need a text editor, something like MS Word for programming.  A professional editor includes tools that make writing code easier, things like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and indenting blocks of text.  The editor recommended for this course is called [Brackets](https://brackets.io/), and it was made by the people at Adobe. It is a popular tool for web development due to its built in web server (NodeJS) which allows you to live preview your web pages.

The core of Brackets is a basic text editor with some code smart features.  To make our lives easier, we will extend it with some add-ons specific to the work that we will be doing.  As you learn to work with Brackets, feel free to look for additional extensions to suit your own personal likes and needs.


### Web Browsers
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) is the main browser that we will use for this course, and is required for the Live Preview feature in Brackets. However, it is a good practice to test your site in all major browsers - Chrome, Firefox, IE (Windows) and Safari (Mac). We will not focus extensively on specific cross-browser issues, however we HTML5 backwards compatibility and cross-browser issues will be discussed at a high-level.


### File & Version Management
Configuration files and code are important assets to an organization. Likewise the files you create as part of this course are important assets to you. We will be learning to manage these files professionally using a source code management tool called git which maintains versions of files inside of a repository and [GitHub](https://github.com/) a free, public cloud hosting service for your git repositories.

If you do not already have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, please visit the website to register for a free public account now.  If you use your student email, you can later request a free Personal account upgrade through the GitHub [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).


### HTML5 & CSS3
While HTML is often referred to as a programming language, and you'll sound a lot more knowledgable and competent if you avoid the mistake of referring to it as one.  Neither HTML nor CSS is a programming language, and you will not be learning to program in this course.  

HTML is actually a markup language.  In fact HTML is an acronym for HyperText Markup Language.  A markup language is used to add elements with specific meanings onto ordinary text.  If you proof-read a paper for someone, you might <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">strikethrough</span> text that they should remove.  You might use a ^ with text above it to indicate stuff they should add.  This is common proof readers markup.  (This is an actual [*thing*](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_proof.html), though if you are young enough to not have had a physical paper proofread you may not believe it.)

CSS is a series of rules with its own special syntax, but it also is not considered a programming language.  CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets.  Style sheets are used to define rules for how content should be presented.  For example you might define a rule to say that all top level headings should appear in purple.

HTML defines what the content of a web page should be. CSS describes how that content should be presented.  Web Browsers understand how to read and process HTML and CSS, and use this information in order to render (or display) a particular web page. Since HTML & CSS are understood by your web browser, there is no install for HTML or CSS like there would be for a programming language.
