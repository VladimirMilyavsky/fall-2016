# Practice using Brackets & GitHub
Let's practice working with Brackets to develop your first web page.

## Prerequisites
The following topics were covered earlier:

- [Internet & Web Basics]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/intro/r4-web-basics.html ): To complete this assignment you should be familiar with the template HTML structure presented in the reading.  
- [Install, Configure, and Use Brackets]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/intro/e1-install-brackets.html ): You should use Brackets to edit the files.  
- [Git & GitHub: Update the Student Directory]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/intro/e3-using-github.html ): I will assume that you are familiar with the process to use git and GitHub to complete this assignment.

## GitHub Project
Begin by getting the starter repository from the course GitHub organization.  For this assignment, we will use the [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page) repository.

Note that this repository contains only a README file and a .gitignore file.

- The README is used to display information about your project in the GitHub web interface.
- The .gitignore is used to tell git to ignore (or not add) particular types of files.

## Build a Simple Web Page
Using Brackets and the template HTML found in the reading to make a minimal HTML page. You should call this page index.html, as that is the default home page for most web servers.

Instead of saying "Hello World", Introduce yourself and tell us what your favorite thing is.  Over the early part of the semester, you'll be making a web site for something you like or are a fan of.  This is your beta fan-page, version 0.5.

Keep this short and to the point.  Only put out there the minimal required tags, but be sure to update the title and the body text.  Make sure that you are using Beautify to keep the file looking *beautiful*.

Let's walk through this together to make sure you are comfortable working with brackets.  
<div style="padding:10px 20px">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">
  {%  include youtube.html  id="yNGaIwDonmQ" %}
</div>
</div>
</div>

## Testing
Be sure to test your page first on your own computer and then after pushing your updates to GitHub. It is very important that you test you page live on the web, as that is what I will be looking at when I grade your work.  Make sure you know how to get to the page on the real internet.  

## Submit
Once you have verified your work, submit a pull-request.  

Be sure to take a screenshot of the pull request to submit on D2L.
