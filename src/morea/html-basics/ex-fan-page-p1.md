## Prerequisites
The following topics were covered earlier:

- [Basic HTML]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/html-basics/read-html-basics.html ): To complete this assignment you should be familiar with the HTML tags presented in the reading and notes and understand how to validate your HTML pages.  
- [Install, Configure, and Use Brackets]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/intro/ex-install-brackets.html ): You should use Brackets to edit the files.  
- [Git & GitHub: Update the Student Directory]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/intro/ex-using-github.html ): I will assume that you are familiar with the process to use git and GitHub to complete this assignment.


## Overview
This will be the first of a multi-part assignment in which you will create a fan page for something you enjoy: a movie, game, band, or even your favorite food or restaurant.  You can choose the topic, but you must make sure that your page also meet the requirements found in each part of the assignment.

*Important*: As you build this site, be careful in the use of images, text, and other content from other sources. Unless you have written or created the content yourself, I expect that you will ask for and get permission before using anyone else's material. You should note such permissions near the content or place it in the footer. You should also note copyright of others materials - for example, note the footer on this page [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/).

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [fan-page](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/fan-page).

Once you have forked and cloned this repository, you do not need to repeat that step again.  Just continue creating and editing files through Brackets and use the git add, commit, and push commands to update GitHub.

Remember that you also do not need to make backups of this content for each phase of the project locally, as that is also done for you on GitHub. By looking at your Commits, you can go back and see any previous version.  

(Students will often make copies of their work and get confused on which code they are editing resulting in mistakes on their assignments. This happens a lot! If you really must do this - you don't trust the cloud - make sure to keep them somewhere completely separate, not in the same folder, and preferably not even on the same drive/computer.)

## Requirements
Update your fan-page index.html file so that it includes:

- The name of your favorite thing you are building the site for
- A link to a different website or other information about this thing.
- A summary of what this thing is and what you like about it.
- A list of something (ordered or unordered).
- A header with the site name
- At least two subheadings.
- A footer with copyright information.  You own the copyright to your own page, so use your name and the current year.
- An email contact link for you in the footer.  To avoid putting your real email on the page you can use yourFirstName@yourLastName.com or something like that, so long as it is a proper email link, I don't care if it actually works.

Do not neglect the <head> section just because it is not visible on the web page. You should include a title and the charset.

## Testing
Once you are happy with your work, push it up to GitHub.  Make sure to check the display of your page live on GitHub Pages and re-validate your page by URL.

## Submit
Create a pull-request and submit the screenshot of it in the Assignment box on D2L.
