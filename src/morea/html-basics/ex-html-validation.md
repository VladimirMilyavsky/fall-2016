## Prerequisites
HTML Validation is introduced in the textbook in Chapter 2.  If you have not completed the reading, please do so and review the chapter notes [Basic HTML]() before continuing with this assignment.

Additional information on validation can be found on the [W3C website](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Validating_your_HTML).

## GitHub Project
Begin by getting the starter repository from the course GitHub organization.  For this assignment, we will use the [validation-lab](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/validation-lab) repository.

## Fix the Page
Open the repository folder in Brackets.  Take a look at the index.html page, however even if you see things that are incorrect do not fix them yet. Go to the validator on the web and validate this file.

You should use the [W3C HTML Validator Nu](https://html5.validator.nu/) to validate your pages.  It is more up to date than the old validator used in the textbook.  The display is a bit different, but the options and output are essentially the same.

Beginning with the first error shown, correct the error and then revalidate the page.  Often correcting one error will eliminate others.  It might also generate more.

By correcting one error at a time, at least for this lab, it will help you to learn the meaning of some of the less than clear error messages that can come from validating your pages.

## Testing
Once all of the errors are correct, test the display of the page.  It should display with a main heading and two subheadings each with a paragraph of text underneath.

## Submit
Once you have verified your work, push it up to GitHub.  I strongly recommend that you get into the habit of re-validating your pages by using the URL.  This prevents any errors creeping in accidentally.  This has happens more often than you would think.

Once you are happy with the results.  Create the pull-request and submit the screenshot of it in the Assignment box on D2L.
