This assignment includes the case study work from Chapters 10, 11 & 12 in your textbook.

  :exclamation: Overall the Pacific Trails Case Study will follow the case study from the textbook, but how we get from beginning to end will be a little different in places. Please use these instructions to direct your work.

Make sure to check the feedback for your previous assignment on GitHub. Note that errors that are not fixed will continue to have points deducted each week.

## Introduction
In our fourth meeting with Melanie from the Pacific Trails, we go over the work that was completed in the last iteration, and then talk about the changes for the next round of work.  This iteration focuses on responsive design for tablet & mobile devices.

## Chapter 10
Adding the Reservations page with the form is pretty straightforward. However you should pay attention to the details in the instructions.  Make sure that you have the correct input types specified and configure them reasonably.  You probably don't want a reservation staying 0 nights for example.  Also, many students miss the CSS to stack the label over the input field for the mobile display.

## Chapter 11
The addition of the home page video and the nav transition is also fairly straightforward, but many students struggle with the addition of the the image gallery. *Make sure to allow sufficient time for this work.*

Images & Captions:

- photo2.jpg - Rocky Coastline
- photo3.jpg - Clouds Moving In
- photo4.jpg - Waterfall Near Big Sur
- photo6.jpg - Sunset on the Coast

Use photo2 as the “placeholder” image on the left, faded out as initial display.  Then on hover, show the larger image for the thumbnail hovered in place of that placeholder image.

It can be very helpful to first work through the Hands On Practice 11.8 on pages 368-369. Make small changes and test as you complete each step. The gallery will look messy until all of the CSS is added, so it is helpful to see the starting point and understand how each change should alter that along the way. If you work through this first with an example that you have solution files for, the gallery in the case study will go much smoother.

## Chapter 12
This is a small and simple task, and pretty much the only way to mess it up is to forget to do it, or to forget to add it to all pages.  Write a reasonable description, but don't feel like you need it to be perfect and polished.  It should give the true business owner some idea of what to include, so that they can polish the text for you later.


## Testing and Submit
When everything looks good, create the pull request to have your work graded.

This is the last case study assignment, so remember that this grade will not be dropped.  Test well to ensure you get the highest grade possible for your work.
