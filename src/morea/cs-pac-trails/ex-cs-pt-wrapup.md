## Reflection Paper
To wrap-up the project, you should write a short 750-1000 page reflection paper on the case study experience.  You should consider the purpose of the case study project, and discuss what you feel you learned from the project.  This can include HTML & CSS topics, but should also include less technical learnings on working on a project of this size.  You might consider things like the project timeline, agile project management, and interactions with the business customer.

This paper should be written in MS Word.  You will be assessed on both your content and writing. This includes how well you organized and presented your thoughts as well as correct spelling and grammar.
