This assignment includes the case study work from both Chapters 8 & 9 in your textbook.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  :exclamation: Overall the Pacific Trails Case Study will follow the case study from the textbook, but how we get from beginning to end will be a little different in places. Please use these instructions to direct your work.

Make sure to check the feedback for your previous assignment on GitHub. Note that errors that are not fixed will continue to have points deducted each week.

## Introduction
In our fourth meeting with Melanie from the Pacific Trails, we go over the work that was completed in the last iteration, and then talk about the changes for the next round of work.  This iteration focuses on responsive design for tablet & mobile devices.

## GitHub
Continue working with your forked copy of the [cs-pacific-trails](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/cs-pacific-trails) repository from part 3.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
:warning: <strong>Do NOT make a new folder for each chapter or part of the assignment.</strong>
</div>

## Chapter 8
Be sure to make any necessary correction from the previous work first. If the layout from Chapter 7 is not correct, the instructions for adding the media query CSS will not work correctly.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
:exclamation: The order of your CSS is crucial to having this work!  Make sure <em>all</em> your desktop CSS is at the top, followed by all of the CSS in the media query for tablet, followed by all of the CSS in the media query for mobile.
</div>

I encourage you to do the changes for each layout separately.  First add any changes to the desktop styles & test, then update the tablet styles & test, the update the mobile styles and test.  As the tablet styles build on the desktop and the mobile styles build on the tablet, this will help you troubleshoot any issues.  

Make sure that you are adjusting the size of your browser window to see the layout switch between the desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

## Chapter 9
Adding the table to the Yurts page is pretty straightforward. Pay attention to the instructions however, as many students miss that all table text should be centered, *except* for the description. You must add a style class to un-center, or left-align, the description cell content.


## Testing and Submit
When everything looks good, create the pull request to have your work graded.

Remember that while you can continue working on the case study locally, it is helpful if you do not push any additional changes to GitHub until the assignment has been graded. I will aim to have feedback to you within a few days of your submission, so you won't have to wait long.
