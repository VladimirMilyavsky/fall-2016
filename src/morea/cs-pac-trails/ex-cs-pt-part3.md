# {{ page.title }}
This assignment includes the case study work from Chapter 7 in your textbook.  

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  :exclamation: Overall the Pacific Trails Case Study will follow the case study from the textbook, but how we get from beginning to end will be a little different in places. Please use these instructions to direct your work.

Make sure to check the feedback for your previous assignment on GitHub. Note that errors that are not fixed will continue to have points deducted each week.

## Introduction
In our third meeting with Melanie from the Pacific Trails, we go over the work that was completed in the last iteration, and then talk about the changes for the next round of work.  This iteration focuses on a new layout for the web pages.

<div style="padding:20px">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-push-2">
  {%  include youtube.html  id="kMlXJPEduiY" %}
</div>
</div>
</div>

## GitHub
Continue working with your forked copy of the [cs-pacific-trails](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/cs-pacific-trails) repository from part 2. There is no need to fork the repository again.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
:warning: <strong>Do NOT make a new folder for each chapter or part of the assignment.</strong>
</div>


## Chapter 7
The case study instructions from the end of Chapter 7 have you adjust the page layout to a two-column design layout. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully to avoid layout errors.

I encourage you to make small changes and then test. Try to guess how the page will look after each change and then see if you were correct. This will help you learn how to come up with the CSS yourself. The book will not always be there telling you what to enter. Make sure you understand how this 2-column layout comes together so that you can repeat it on a different site.

Pay attention to the order of the styles for your navigation links. If these are not in the correct order, they will not "cascade" correctly and will not behave the way that you might expect them to.


## Testing and Submit
When everything looks good, create the pull request to have your work graded.

Remember that while you can continue working on the case study locally, it is helpful if you do not push any additional changes to GitHub until the assignment has been graded. I will aim to have feedback to you within a few days of your submission, so you won't have to wait long.
